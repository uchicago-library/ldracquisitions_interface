# Introduction

The acquisitions interface is a Javascript/Python-Flask application for allowing workers to add acquisitions and accession records into the ldr. In order to facilitate that purpose it has three major sections

1. An acquisition form submission page
2. An accession form submission page
3. A list of accessions

As extra information, there is:

1. an about page describing
    - how each type of user should use the site
    - a FAQ list
2. a list of accession records

# Major Responsibilities

1. Be a location for SPCL users to enter data about new resources about to be added to the LDR
2. Be a location for SPCL users to review data about resource that have been added to the LDR
3. Feed data entered by SPCL users into a central database of information about resources in the LDR

# Pages in the Application

1. first page : the choice between all-digital or partially physical acquisition
2. acquisition form page
3. accession form page
4. donor form page
5. source form page
6. physical media form page
7. list of acquisitions
8. list of accessions

# Types of Forms

## Acquisition Record

### Introduction

The acquisition record is the one that a student worker fills out. It contains 56% of the information record in the accession form.

The main purpose of this form is to provide a rapid means for the student worker to submit new resources to accession into the LDR. This form is then picked up by the Digital Accession Specialist in a list.

It has the following fields:

* accession identifier = must be four numerals followed by a dash followed by three numerals
* collection title = must be a string ending with the word "Collection"
* receipt letter info required = may be True, default is False

# Research on implementing this interface in Wagtail

Possibility to install this interface into Wagtail. This would require

- developing a custom wagtail page type for the accession and acquisition forms
- develop a streamfield for listing ajax items
    * would have to be able to list acquisitions with the required data
    * would have to be able to list accessions with the required data
- all custom page types and streamfields be useable by everyone who has write access to the library website [see wagtail doc for streamfileds and block types](http://docs.wagtail.io/en/v1.5.2/topics/streamfield.html?highlight=streamfield)
- a wagtail page type would need to be developed to hold the form and various data lists that need to be on the page for each form (see [wagtail doc for page blocks](http://docs.wagtail.io/en/v1.5.2/topics/pages.html?highlight=page%20type)
- would need to develop a form for the acquisition and accession in wagtail [see wagtail doc for forms](http://docs.wagtail.io/en/v1.5.2/reference/contrib/forms.html?highlight=form)
- wagtail has an api that can be extended [see api doc](http://docs.wagtail.io/en/v1.5.2/reference/contrib/api/usage.html)

Of potentila use, though I don't see the immediate use case right now, is that wagtail has a read-onlyAPI [see the api doc](http://docs.wagtail.io/en/v1.5.2/reference/contrib/api/usage.html)
