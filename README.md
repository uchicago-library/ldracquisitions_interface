# Introduction

The acquisitions interface is a Javascript/Python-Flask application for allowing workers to add acquisitions and accession records into the ldr. In order to facilitate that purpose it has three major sections

1. An acquisition form submission page
2. An accession form submission page
3. A list of accessions

As extra information, there is:

1. an about page describing 
    - how each type of user should use the site
    - a FAQ list
2. a list of accession records

# Major Responsibilities

1. Be a location for SPCL users to enter data about new resources about to be added to the LDR 
2. Be a location for SPCL users to review data about resource that have been added to the LDR
3. Feed data entered by SPCL users into a central database of information about resources in the LDR


# Types of Forms

The acquisition record is the one that a student worker fills out. It contains 56% of the information record in the accession form.
