                <h2>What do you need to do?</h2>
                <h3>I need to make a record for a recent acquisition to the LDR</h3>
                <p>In that case, you need to create an acquisition record. This is the easiest record to create: you just fill
                    in as much information with as much accuracy as possible at this time and click Save. Later, the Digital
                    Accessions Specialist will follow up with you in order to verify that all the information is correct
                    so that she/he can create an accession record.
                </p>
                <p>After you click on the Proceed button, you should follow all of the instructions on the proceeding pages.
                    Once all the information that is required, you should click on the "Save" button on the Acquisiton form.
                    This will cause one of two things:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A successful save in which case you will be brought to a new page with a receipt identifying the acquisition
                        record you just created.</li>
                    <li>A list of errors at the top of the page that the LDR found with the acquisition that you should now correct
                        in your record.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You are the front line of the LDR: without you nothing could get started.</p>
                <p class="center">
                    <a href="index.html" class="btn btn-primary" role="button">Proceed</a>
                </p>

                <h3>I need to transform an acquisition record</h3>
                <p>
                    You are probably a Digital Accessions Specialist. Your job is to find the acquisition record in question from the list, and
                    add all the additional information needed for a full accession record. You also need to double-check
                    the acquisition record to make sure all the information presented is complete and correct. Remember:
                    you are the last line of defiense between a mistake causing an acqusiition to get let lost or some crucial
                    step not being completed.
