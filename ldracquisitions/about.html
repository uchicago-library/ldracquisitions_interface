                <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
                <h3>I am a student worker</h3>
                <p>Your job is to create an acquisition record. This is the first record of a particular group of resources in the LDR system, so it's important that you try to be as accurate as you can with the infromation that you have while filling out
                    the form. Don't worry too much, though, since the Digital Accessions Specialist will be double-checking all of your work. Once you have filled out all of the core information, all the information about the donors and sources, all of
                    the information about the media that these resources came from, and the restrictions that Special Collections has designated for these resources, then click on the Save button. This will perform one last check of your work according
                    the specification for an acquisiiton record and if all is correct than you will be given a receipt proving that you completed this form, If all is not correct, you will be shown a list of erros that you should correct before submitting
                    the acquiisition form again.</p>
                <p class="center">
                    <a href="index.html" class="btn btn-primary" role="button">Proceed</a>
                </p>
                <p>

                <h3>I am a Digital Accessions Specialist</h3>
                <p>
                    Bad news: you've got a little bit more to do than the student worker. Good news: it's not that much extra work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You need to make sure the acquisition form that the student worker filled out is correct. You also need to add all extra required information for an accession record before submitting it for final inclusion in a stage directory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The accession record is the full description of the resources that will be included in the archive package. It will also serve as the base description for the first conceptual arrangement of the resources. So, it's up to you to make absolutely certain that the information that you transmit is complete and correct before transmitting it to be stored in the LDR.
